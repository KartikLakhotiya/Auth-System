## Deployment Note

This project has been successfully deployed online as I have a registered domain. However, if you do not have a domain, please be aware that Mailtrap only allows sending emails to accounts associated with your Mailtrap account. As a result, deploying this project without a registered domain may not make sense, since you wonâ€™t be able to send emails to other users.

If you have a domain, feel free to deploy the project to leverage its full email functionality!
